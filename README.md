# Simply Life Simulator
It's my project on object-oriented programming classes at computer science studies.

It's made with Java, Gradle and JavaFX.
On the 2D map spawns given number of animals, which can move, regenerate energy by eating "grass" and reproduce. 
Each animal has it's own genes, which determinate it's abilitie to move. Only strongest (with highest energy) on each square will repoduce and pass genes for their child based on energy ratio between parents. 
Grass spawns randomly, but has higher concentration in the middle of map called "jungle".
